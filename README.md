**Chatbot using Llama3.2 Locally (Ollama)**


This project demonstrates how to create a local chatbot using the Ollama Llama3.2:3B model. It allows you to interact with an AI chatbot in a conversational manner directly from your terminal. The chatbot uses the langchain_ollama package to interface with the Llama3.2 model and handle user input.

```
```

Prompt Handling: The chatbot uses langchain's ChatPromptTemplate to structure the conversation.
Context Handling: The context variable stores the conversation history to provide context to the model.
